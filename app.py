            Corals play a vital role in maintaining a healthy aquatic ecosystem, 
            but their bleaching has become a major concern as it disrupts the balance
            of the ecosystem. Early detection of bleached corals is crucial in 
            preventing potential disasters to aquatic life.

            The main objective of this web application is to classify either a coral image is
            bleached or unbleached through the use of machine learning algorithms.
            This classification can help identify bleached corals at an early stage and allow for 
            timely intervention, ultimately contributing to the preservation and protection 
            of the aquatic ecosystem.
